# Movie_Lens_20M

This Notebook presents analysis of Movie Lens dataset and Collaborative filtering on it using Apache Spark.

This has problem rendering on Github so I have published it seperately [here](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/1457916220563996/3123150065672593/1920439544921018/latest.html)

Data can be found [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) or at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset). 

Also, I have used [Databricks community edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) here the dataset is already mounted and it comes with Tones of features.
